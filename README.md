# URI-Solved
All the solution of URI I have done.

The URI Online Judge is a project that is being developed by the Computer Science Department of URI University. 
The main goal of the project is to provide programming practice and knowledge sharing.

As a challengee, improve my ranking, solving as many problems as possible and tunning my source code to run fast.
